# Support Bank

### Data files are not present
If you perform `dotnet run` you will recieve the error: `Could not find a part of the path 'C:\...\support-bank-resources\Transactions2014.csv'`. This is because the csv file isn't present. You need to obtain it and put it into a directory called `support-bank-resources`.

### Adding the csv file to the project
Go to the [support bank resources](https://github.com/techswitch-learners/support-bank-resources) repository, then clone that repository into your project directory.
